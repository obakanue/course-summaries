### Types and Values
The different data types existing in JavaScript/TypeScript is the following:

**- String:**
In order to create a string value you enclose it with either ' or ". Strings are immutable, this means you can't change an initiated string value but instead you create a new string value. Note however, a String object which you create with the String() constructor, is mutable. Here is some example code:
'''
let string1 = "This is a string";
let string2 = 'This is also a string';
let string3 = 'This is a string with an ${expression} in it'
'''

Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions.

**-Number:**


* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Object
* Symbol
