# One Dimensional Analysis B2
This summary is just the basics of the one dimensional analysis B2. The most important parts in the course necessary for being able to pass the exam. At some point I might include some solutions for some problems. As you probably already know, there is a great infamous [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrpJbMwAD5g&list=PL2w8yt28pgXojngg4qkQjaWHJymZ_xCg_) from Jonas MÃ¥nsson for this course.

Here is the course link for [one dimensional analysis](http://www.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/personal/magnusa/kurser/endim-ht2016/B2/)(ICT-students).

## Summary
Here the summary starts, a small collection of what could be gathered from the lectures.

### Complex Numbers
We will start with the complex numbers, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrpJbMwAD5g&list=PL2w8yt28pgXojngg4qkQjaWHJymZ_xCg_) is another link to the start of the video-series for this section.

#### Complex Numbers - Background
In order to understand complex numbers we will have to define what different types of numbers there are:
* **Natural numbers** - This includes all the positive discrete numbers and zero (0, 1, 2, 3, 4...).  
Example equation: x + 2 = 5 <=> x = 3
