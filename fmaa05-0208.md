# One Dimensional Analysis B2
This summary is just the basics of the one dimensional analysis B2. The most important parts in the course necessary for being able to pass the exam. At some point I might include some solutions for some problems. As you probably already know, there is the great infamous [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrpJbMwAD5g&list=PL2w8yt28pgXojngg4qkQjaWHJymZ_xCg_) from Jonas MÃ¥nsson for this course.
