# Advanced Interaction Design MAMN01 2019 VT
In this summary I will try to collect the basics and important terminology surrounding the course. Hopefully it will help when writing the report. The end goal would be for this summary to be the only necessary source in order to complete the course.

## Introduction
Here are some links for where you will find specific course materials and software. I will also go showcase some of the assignments to be completed during the run of this course.

This is the current Course Admin:

### Links
Here are some helpful links for the course:
* [Moodle](http://moodle.lth.se) Here you will find all course material for your course.
* [Course Page](http://www.eat.lth.se/kurser/interaktionsdesign/avancerad-interaktionsdesign-mamn01/) This is the course page.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Here you can download Android Studio if you don't already have it.

## Repetition of terminology
This part is meant to jugg a bit of your memory from past terminology from previous courses.

### Prototypes
The most basic definition of prototype is, “A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.” The goal of a prototype is to test products (and product ideas) before sinking lots of time and money into the final product.

Prototypes have four main qualities:
* **Representation** — The actual form of the prototype, i.e., paper and mobile, or HTML and desktop.
* **Precision** — The fidelity of the prototype, meaning its level of detail, polish, and realism.
* **Interactivity** — The functionality open to the user, e.g., fully functional, partially functional, or view-only
* **Evolution** — The lifecycle of the prototype. Some are built quickly, tested, thrown away, and then replaced with an improved version (this is known as “rapid prototyping”). Others may be built and improved upon, ultimately evolving into the final product.

There are generally two types of prototypes:
* **Horisontal prototype** - Lots of functions but low on details.
* **Vertical prototype** - Few functions but high on details.

**LoFi-prototype** is an example of a primarily *horistonal* prototype, while **HiFi-prototype** is a lot closer to the finished product and is usually a lot more of a *vertical* prototype high on detail.

**T-prototype** is an example of a *vertical* and *horisontal* prototype where you showcase what intended features are, but really only go into depth of a few. The more functions with high detail the more "legs" the T-prototype has.
