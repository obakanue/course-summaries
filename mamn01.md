# Advanced Interaction Design MAMN01 2019 VT
In this summary I will try to collect the basics and important terminology surrounding the course. Hopefully it will help when writing the report. The end goal would be for this summary to be the only necessary source in order to complete the course.

## Introduction
Here are some links for where you will find specific course materials and software. I will also go showcase some of the assignments to be completed during the run of this course.

This is the current Course Admin:  
Name:   Kirsten "Kirre" Rassmus-Gröhn   
E-mail: kirre@certec.lth.se   
Phone:  046 - 222 03 50  

### Links
Here are some helpful links for the course:
* [Moodle](http://moodle.lth.se) Here you will find all course material for your course.
* [Course Page](http://www.eat.lth.se/kurser/interaktionsdesign/avancerad-interaktionsdesign-mamn01/) This is the course page.
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Here you can download Android Studio if you don't already have it.
* [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) This is the programming language you all will be using.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) This is really important for version handling, you don't have to use GitHub but it is recommended since it is so easy tracking versions of your project and for working together in a team.

### Literature
Here is a list of some authors with helpful literature:
* Norman
* Preece, Rogers, Sharp
* Arvola

### Programming tools
This is the programming tools you will need for the project:
* Java Development Kit
* Android Studio
* GitHub

### Project Assignment
You are to create an app for the android using java with non-traditional interaction. You will be in a team of four where the other team-members will be chosen for you by course admin. If you miss an obligatory event contact course admin to get an assignment since deadline will be one week from missed occassion. In parallell to the app you will also write a report that describes the design process and your decisions.

You will need the following equipment which you may also have access to in school or borrow from course admin:
* A computer
* Android phone

The laid out guide-lines are:
* Tuition once a week with your mentor.
* Brainstorming event with the group.
* Presentation of conceptual idea.
* Presentation of work in progress.
* Showcase fair with everyones products.

For every occassion your group will have to bring an android phone where you can test your app. You will also have to show your progress while discussing progress, problems, fears and future plans.

As a start you will have a workshop for setting up the enviroment in Android Studio and testing the individual assignment "Hello Sensor". This assignment is only pass or fail.

All code should be put on GitHub, where your mentor is to be invited as well. All borrowed code has to be referenced, and it is desirable in this project since you will be able to focus more on the design rather than function.

The presentation of the work in progress is supposed to be like an elevator pitch. It is desirable to use powerpoint as an aid during the presentation. You should also send the slides one day before the presentation.

### Report
You are as mentioned to write an report where you describe your design process. You will find the template on [Moodle](http://moodle.lth.se).

The report consists of:
* Theory
* Method
* Explanation of motivation of design decisions
* Explanation of the prototype

Keep the report updated everytime you work on the project.

You will leave feedback on eachothers reports.

### Individual reflection
You will also write an A4 paper of your individual experience from the project, it should be around 450-750 words.

These are the content titles:
* My greatest contribution to the project.
* My project members greatest contribution to the project.
* What I've learned from the project. (Most important part)

## Repetition of Terminology
This part is meant to jugg a bit of your memory from past terminology from previous courses.

### Prototypes
The most basic definition of prototype is, “A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch.” The goal of a prototype is to test products (and product ideas) before sinking lots of time and money into the final product.

Prototypes have four main qualities:
* **Representation** — The actual form of the prototype, i.e., paper and mobile, or HTML and desktop.
* **Precision** — The fidelity of the prototype, meaning its level of detail, polish, and realism.
* **Interactivity** — The functionality open to the user, e.g., fully functional, partially functional, or view-only
* **Evolution** — The lifecycle of the prototype. Some are built quickly, tested, thrown away, and then replaced with an improved version (this is known as “rapid prototyping”). Others may be built and improved upon, ultimately evolving into the final product.

There are generally two types of prototypes:
* **Horisontal prototype** - Lots of functions but low on details.
* **Vertical prototype** - Few functions but high on details.

**LoFi-prototype** is an example of a primarily *horistonal* prototype, while **HiFi-prototype** is a lot closer to the finished product and is usually a lot more of a *vertical* prototype high on detail.

**T-prototype** is an example of a *vertical* and *horisontal* prototype where you showcase what intended features are, but really only go into depth of a few. The more functions with high detail the more "legs" the T-prototype has.

### User centered design process
A common problem with developing a product is a two-way road.
* The designer just understands a small part of the users problem.
* The user overestimates the designer’s understanding of the problem.

By integrating the user in all the parts of the design process you will be much more likely to develop a successfull product.

Here are some great buzz-words to use for the report: *Understanding*, *users*, *tasks*, *enviroments*, *evaluation*, *iterative*, *whole user ecperience*, *multidiciplinary*.
