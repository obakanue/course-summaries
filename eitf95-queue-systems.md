## Exercises


### Exercise 1
This is the solutions for the exercises to exercise 1 and description to "expected knowledge" after finnishing the exercise.

#### Terminology
This is the theory you are supposed to understand after the exercise:
* **Discrete and continuous random variables:**  A *discrete variable* is a variable which can only take a countable number of values. In this example, the number of heads can only take 4 values (0, 1, 2, 3) and so the variable is discrete. The variable is said to be random if the sum of the probabilities is one.  
   A *continuous random variable* is a random variable where the data can take infinitely many values. For example, a random variable measuring the time taken for something to be done is continuous since there are an infinite number of possible times that can be taken.
* **Cumulative distribution function for a continuous random variable:** In probability theory and statistics, the *cumulative distribution function* (CDF) of a real-valued random variable X X, or just distribution function of  X X, evaluated at  x x, is the probability that  X X will take a value less than or equal to  x x.  In the case of a *continuous distribution*, it gives the area under the probability density function from minus infinity to  x x. Cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of multivariate random variables.
